# Pipeline for assembly of SARS-CoV-2 sequences

Uses a combination of de novo assembly and read mapping to generate consensus sequences from raw fastq data. 

Written to run on Fred Hutch HPC infrastructure but can be adapted to other platforms with the relevant dependencies installed (all open source). 

There's also a branch that has a nextflow-based implementation if you prefer.
